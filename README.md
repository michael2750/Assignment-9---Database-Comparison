# Assignment-9---Database-Comparison

The main file with quries can be found [here](https://github.com/cph-lh/Assignment-9---Database-Comparison/blob/master/DatabaseCompairson/src/main/java/Connector/Queries.java)

I have decided to small csv files even tho Helge said we shouldnt, since it took way to long to preform thees quries on the bit dataset.

This assignment was made with MySQL WorkBench, Netbeans and Neo4j.
I made a maven project in netbeans as seen in my repository, and Im using the class
[DBConnector](https://github.com/cph-lh/Assignment-9---Database-Comparison/blob/master/DatabaseCompairson/src/main/java/Connector/DBConnector.java)
to establish my connection, and Im using the class
[Queries](https://github.com/cph-lh/Assignment-9---Database-Comparison/blob/master/DatabaseCompairson/src/main/java/Connector/Queries.java)
as my main and this executes the Depth 1-5 assignment and measures the execution time.

[SQL queries](https://github.com/cph-lh/Assignment-9---Database-Comparison/blob/master/Part3.sql)

Havent got to the Neo4j part! :(

Execution time:
